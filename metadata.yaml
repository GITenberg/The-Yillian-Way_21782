description: The ceremonious protocol of the Yills was impressive, colorful, and,
  in the long run, deadly! It was up to Jame Retief to figure out how to respond to
  the Yill's overtures in the correct manner; all the while keeping his superiors
  from making a deadly mistake. Only one man could think quickly enough to get the
  job done!
